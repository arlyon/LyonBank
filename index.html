    <h1>An Introduction to Ethereum</h1>
    <h3>A decentralized an anonymous new crypto-currency.</h3>
    <p>The ethereum platform is, shortly, a distributed computing network that creates and manages a
        indisputable ledger of transactions. Additionally it provides some functionality that allows
        programs to be compiled and run on the network, by the computers hosting the network. Making
        transactions requires ether, the native currency on the platform. Like a car, the ethereum
        platform runs on gas and ether is the fuel.
    </p>
    <p>Ethereum uses <a
        href="https://github.com/ethereumbuilders/ethereum101/wiki/Public-Key-Cryptography">public-key
        cryptography</a> (it is a crypto-coin after all) that works very
        similarly to message encryption. A user gives out their public key and others use that to
        encrypt the message. Now that it has been encrypted with the public key, the only way to get
        anything meaningful out of the encrypted message is to decrypt it with the private key. The
        ethereum platform works in a similar manner. When an account is generated, an algorithm
        spits out a random public key and its corresponding private key. Only the owner of the
        private key can make any transactions on the behalf of the account. This includes sending
        ether, which means that we have uncovered a glaring vulnerability.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="centered">
    <h1>The Current Security Landscape</h1>
    <h3>A central and catastrophic point of failure.</h3>
    <p>In its current form, ethereum wallets have a single point of failure. Anyone with access to a
        wallet's private key has full control over all the funds in that account meaning any
        security breach is catastrophic and irreversible. There are multiple methods that we can use
        to mitigate these problems, all of which share the same shortcoming. One of
        the most common alternatives is splitting your funds into hot-and-cold wallets. Acting
        similarly to a checking-and-savings account, a cold wallet stores the majority of your
        assets, letting you manage them from an offline or air-gapped wallet to ensure isolation
        from malicious software. The primary ideology here is that if your "hot" wallet, or checking
        account were compromised, your "cold" wallet, or savings account would remain safe.
        This method still has a central point of failure. If a key is compromised (or lost)
        funds are irreversibly gone. If you save the key in only one place, you risk losing the key
        (ex. from a fire); the only way to counter this is to save the key in multiple places which
        opens up another vulnerability: theft, physical or electronic.
    </p>
    <p>To patch this vulnerability, it would be beneficial to take the human out of the equation.
        Luckily, as mentioned briefly in the introduction, because ethereum is a computing platform,
        rather than just another block chain crypto-currency, we can create a solution that
        completely absolves the risk of losing a key or worse. This revolves around a class-like
        structure on the ethereum block chain: the smart contract. The public and immutable ledger
        that ethereum is built on ensures that any code fused with it operates exactly as defined,
        with no way of modifying it. This contract then exists on the decentralized network, ready
        to be used by anyone, and then executed by everyone.

    <h1>The Lyon Banking Contract</h1>
    <h3>A safe banking method to store the ethereum of multiple users.</h3>
    <p>Smart contracts have all the rights of a regular account, but are controlled by code. This
        means that they may hold and spend ether, just like a regular account. Additionally, a
        standard known as <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20">ERC20</a> has defined
        what is now known as tokens or coins that exist as sub-currency on the platform. These can
        be created by any contract, and the contract needs only support a small set of functions to
        make it ERC-20 compliant. Using a combination of the contracts' account-like properties,
        some unique functions, and our own token, we can safely trade ether with the contract, and
        in return receive tokens that have no value but can be traded back in for the original
        deposit. As it stands, nothing would stop a potential attacker from cashing out the tokens,
        making it no safer than a cold wallet; that is assuming they know that the account even
        has the tokens in the first place. To prevent this, we implement some additional fail-safes.
    </p>
    <p>The system relies on three separate layers, outlined below.
    </p>

<div id="infographic">
    <div id="management" class="shifted front">

            <div>
                <h2>Managers</h2>
                <p>
                    Two trusted addresses are assigned the role of managing the withdrawals. Any
                    attempts to cash in tokens will then need to be approved manually.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The third address is safely stored such that both managers must be present to
                    access it. This means that a compromised manager can be swapped out for a new,
                    (secure) address with zero asset loss.
                </p>

                <h2>Transactions</h2>
                <p>
                    A withdrawal request is made, and upon confirmation the ether is deposited back
                    into the owner's account and the equivalent tokens retracted. Any transaction
                    is cancellable.
                </p>

            </div>

                <p>
                    Funds are deposited into the bank in return for tokens. These cannot be
                    cashed in or traded without approval from the managers, meaning the tokens
                    are theft resistant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The tokens mean that if a user were to lose their address, their cold funds are
                    safe inside the bank and the tokens can be transferred easily to a new address.

    <h1>Events</h1>
    <h3>Communication between the decentralized and the centralized.</h3>
    <p>
        The blockchain is a list of blocks which are fundamentally lists of transactions. Each
        transaction has an attached receipt which contains zero or more log entries. Log entries
        represent the result of events having fired from a smart contract.
    </p>
    <p>
        Events are dispatched signals the smart contracts can fire. DApps, or anything connected to
        Ethereum JSON-RPC API, can listen to these events and act accordingly. Event can be indexed,
        so that the event history is searchable later.
